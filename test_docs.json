    "examples/sample_documents.txt": "Python Programming Language\n\nPython is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.\n\nKey Features:\n- Easy to learn and use\n- Extensive standard library\n- Cross-platform compatibility\n- Strong community support\n- Used in web development, data science, AI, and automation\n\nPython is widely used in various domains including web development with frameworks like Django and Flask, data analysis with pandas and numpy, machine learning with scikit-learn and TensorFlow, and automation scripting.\n\nThe language's philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python, which emphasizes simplicity, readability, and explicit over implicit code. ",
    "examples/web_development.txt": "Web Development Technologies\n\nWeb development encompasses the creation of websites and web applications. It involves both frontend and backend development, using various technologies and frameworks to build interactive and dynamic web experiences.\n\nFrontend Technologies:\n- HTML for structure\n- CSS for styling and layout\n- JavaScript for interactivity\n- React, Vue, and Angular for modern frameworks\n\nBackend Technologies:\n- Node.js and Express for JavaScript servers\n- Python with Django or Flask\n- Ruby on Rails\n- PHP with Laravel\n- Java with Spring Boot\n\nDatabase Technologies:\n- SQL databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL\n- NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Redis\n- GraphQL for efficient data querying\n\nModern web development emphasizes responsive design, progressive web apps, and accessibility. The field is constantly evolving with new tools and best practices emerging regularly.\n\nKey concepts include RESTful APIs, microservices architecture, containerization with Docker, and deployment strategies using cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. ",
    "examples/machine_learning.txt": "Machine Learning Fundamentals\n\nMachine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\n\nTypes of Machine Learning:\n1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled training data\n2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data\n3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through interaction with environment\n\nCommon Applications:\n- Image and speech recognition\n- Natural language processing\n- Recommendation systems\n- Fraud detection\n- Medical diagnosis\n- Financial forecasting\n\nPopular algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns.\n\nThe field continues to evolve rapidly with new techniques and applications being developed constantly.
